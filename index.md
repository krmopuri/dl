## (AI2100/AI5100) Deep Learning Course Contents

Starting from an artificial neuron we aim to understand feed forward and recurrent architectures of Artificial Neural Networks. We visit Neurons (MP, perceptron), MLP, CNNs, and RNNs (LSTM and GRU). We will understand how to train these models (via the Gradient Descent technique using the Backpropagation algorithm).
