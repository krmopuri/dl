course_name: Deep Learning
course_description: "Starting from an artificial neuron model, the aim of this course is to understand feed forward and recurrent architectures 
of Artificial Neural Networks, all the way to the modern Deep Neural Networks. Specifically, we will discuss the basic Neuron models (McCulloch Pitts, Perceptron),
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) (LSTM and GRU). We will understand the representational 
ability of these models along with how to train them using the Gradient Descent technique using the Backpropagation algorithm.Â Specifically, we will discuss 
various optimization algorithms such as Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent, Adam, AdaGrad and RMSProp, etc. Towards the end, students of this course get 
exposed to important deep learning frameworks from computer vision and Natural Language Processing such as encoder-decoder architecture, attention mechanism, etc."
